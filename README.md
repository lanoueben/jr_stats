This program will use linear regression to calculate
James Robinson's rushing yards.
This will be a single attribute supervised model
consisting of rush attempts as the input and the
rushing yards as the output.

and theory. The model will make it so for a given
amount of rush attempts, there is a calculated amount
of rushing yards. Univariate linear regression
This program will also use panda's dataframe
